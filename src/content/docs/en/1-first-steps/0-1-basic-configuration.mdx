In this chapter, we'll look at some basic configurations to start working with Git in an organized and secure way.

:::tip
If you already know how to set up your identity, what the `.gitignore` file is, and what an `alias` is, you can skip this lesson.

## Set Up Your Identity <Badge text="git config" variant="note" />

The rest of the world needs to know who wrote that wonderful code, so it's necessary to tell Git who you are. This is done by specifying a name and an email address.

:::note
When working with remote servers, they use the email we configure to identify us. So, if you want the changes you publish to be associated with a specific user account, you should use that same email address.
:::

To configure the username and email address we want to use in our repository, we use Git's configuration commands:

````sh frame=none
git config user.name "Tu Nombre"
git config user.email tucorreo@ejemplo.com
````

This configuration will only apply to this repository. If you always use the same identity, you can configure it globally with the ``--global`` flag. This flag works for any configuration.

````sh frame=none
git config --global user.name "Tu Nombre"
git config --global user.email tucorreo@ejemplo.com
````

This way, all changes we add to our repository will be identified with our information.

## Create Command Shortcuts <Badge text="git config alias" variant="note" />

When using Git via the command line, we'll often find ourselves typing commands frequently; some of these commands can be a bit tedious. However, we can create shorter names to call them, which are known as ``aliases``.

To create a global alias, we can use the ``git config --global`` command followed by the word ``alias`` and, separated by a period, specify the alias name, followed by the command to execute:

````sh frame=none
git config --global alias.nombre_del_alias "comando"
````

For example, the most common alias, which I recommend everyone set up, is for the ``checkout`` command. It's a relatively frequent command, but it's long and a bit tricky to type. So, the standard abbreviation is ``co``:

````sh frame=none
git config --global alias.co checkout
````

Other examples, which I personally don't use, are abbreviations for ``branch``, ``commit`` or ``status``:

````sh frame=none
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
````

### Alias to Publish a New Branch and Link it to the Remote Repository

A personal alias that I find useful simplifies the use of the ``push`` command, which uploads changes to a remote repository (we'll cover this in more detail later). This command can be run directly when we create a branch or want to upload a branch that doesn't exist in the remote repository:a o queremos subir una rama que no existe en el repositorio remoto:

````sh frame=none
git config --global alias.push-origin !git push -u origin "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
````

This command is a bit more complex, but it essentially performs a ``push`` to the repository named origin, 
with ``"$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"`` as a Git utility that returns the name of the current branch. We also use the ``-u`` flag, 
which links our local branch with the remote branch.

If we're on the ``feature-x`` branch, which doesn't exist in the remote repository, and we want to upload our changes, these commands would be equivalent:

````sh frame=none
git push-origin # uso del alias
git push origin feature-x:feature-x -u # comando completo sin alias
git push origin HEAD:feature-x -u # también válido, ya que HEAD es la rama actual
````

We'll explain the details of these commands in the appropriate chapter. For now, let's focus on setting up and using aliases to simplify our workflows.

## Excluding Files from Tracking <Badge text=".gitignore" variant="note" />

In any software project, it's common to want to exclude certain files generated during development, either for security (sensitive information), organization (local configuration files), or space reasons (external libraries and dependencies).

Git provides a solution for specifying all files or paths we want to omit and never include in our changes, through a configuration file called ``.gitignore``. This file can be found both in the repository's root directory and any subdirectory.

You can also use patterns to indicate groups of files or directories. For example, the following sample ``.gitignore`` file would exclude all ``.class`` files from a Java project:

````sh title=".gitignore"
*.class
````

In a Node project, it's essential to omit the ``node_modules directory and all its subdirectories. A typical ``.gitignore`` file for these types of projects might look like this:

````sh title=".gitignore"
# build output
dist/
# generated types
.astro/

# dependencies
node_modules/

# logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*


# environment variables
.env
.env.production

# macOS-specific files
.DS_Store
````

As you can imagine, the file will vary significantly depending on the operating system, project type, etc.

:::tip
It's not necessary to build the entire ``.gitignore`` file manually; there are tools like  [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/) or repositories where we can find example files like  [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
